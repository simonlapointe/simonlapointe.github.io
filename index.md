# Welcome!

I am an Economist in Ottawa, Canada. Previously, I worked as a Senior Researcher at the VATT Institute for Economic Research in Helsinki, Finland. I completed my PhD in Economics in 2016 jointly at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland and the University of Avignon in France. My dissertation is available [here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01503032). Before that, I received a MSc in Economics from the London School of Economics and a BScSoc in Economics from the University of Ottawa.
